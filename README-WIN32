The Windows-32 version of ike-scan uses Cygwin to provide Posix compatibility.

You can run ike-scan in two different ways on a Windows-32 system:

a) Compile ike-scan from source using the Cygwin system.
To do this, you'll need to download the Cygwin Unix environment from
http://www.cygwin.com/.  In addition to the default installation, you'll need
GCC and Make.  Once Cygwin is installed, you can compile ike-scan in the
normal way: ./configure, make, make install.

b) Use the precompiled Windows-32 binary version of ike-scan.
This is the easiest way to get ike-scan running on a Windows-32 system.
The binary package includes the Cygwin DLL.

The Windows-32 version of ike-scan is a command-line tool.  It does not
run as a Windows GUI application.

The main difference between the Unix and Windows versions of ike-scan is
that the default directory for the backoff patterns file on Windows is the
directory where the ike-scan.exe executable resides.  It is possible to
specify the location of the patterns file on both Windows and Unix systems
with the --patterns option.

Currently, the Windows-32 version of ike-scan is know to run on the following
platforms:

Windows NT 4.0
