.SH NAME
ike-scan \- Discover and fingerprint IKE hosts (IPsec VPN servers)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ike-scan
.RI [ options ] " " [ hosts ...]
.PP
Target hosts must be specified on the command line unless the
.B --file
option is specified.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ike-scan
discovers IKE hosts and can also fingerprint them using the
retransmission backoff pattern.
.PP
.B ike-scan
does two things:
.IP 1)
Discovery: Determine which hosts are running IKE.
This is done by displaying those hosts which respond to the IKE requests
sent by
.B ike-scan.
.IP 2)
Fingerprinting: Determine which IKE implementation the hosts are using.
There are several ways to do this: (a) Backoff fingerprinting - recording
the times of the IKE response packets from the target hosts and comparing
the observed retransmission backoff pattern against known patterns; (b) vendor
id fingerprinting - matching the vendor-specific vendor IDs against known
vendor IDs; and (c) proprietary notify message codes.
.PP
The retransmission backoff fingerprinting concept is discussed in more
detail in the UDP backoff fingerprinting paper which should be included
in the ike-scan kit as
.I udp-backoff-fingerprinting-paper.txt.
.PP
The program sends IKE main mode requests to the specified hosts and displays
any responses that are received.  It handles retry and retransmission with
backoff to cope with packet loss.  It also limits the amount of bandwidth
used by the outbound IKE packets.
.PP
IKE is the Internet Key Exchange protocol which is the key exchange and
authentication mechanism used by IPsec.  Just about all modern VPN systems
implement IPsec, and the vast majority of IPsec VPNs use IKE for key exchange.
Main mode is one of the modes defined for phase-1 of the IKE exchange (the
other defined mode is aggressive mode).  RFC 2409 section 5 specifies that
main mode must be implemented, therefore all IKE implementations can
be expected to support main mode.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --help or -h
Display this usage message and exit.
.TP
.B --file=<fn> or -f <fn>
Read hostnames or addresses from the specified file
instead of from the command line. One name or IP
address per line.  Use "-" for standard input.
.TP
.B --sport=<p> or -s <p>
Set UDP source port to <p>, default=500, 0=random.
Some IKE implementations require the client to use
UDP source port 500 and will not talk to other ports.
Note that superuser privileges are normally required
to use non-zero source ports below 1024.  Also only
one process on a system may bind to a given source port
at any one time.
.TP
.B --dport=<p> or -d <p>
Set UDP destination port to <p>, default=500.
UDP port 500 is the assigned port number for ISAKMP
and this is the port used by most if not all IKE
implementations.
.TP
.B --retry=<n> or -r <n>
Set total number of attempts per host to <n>,
default=3.
.TP
.B --timeout=<n> or -t <n>
Set initial per host timeout to <n> ms, default=500.
This timeout is for the first packet sent to each host.
subsequent timeouts are multiplied by the backoff
factor which is set with --backoff.
.TP
.B --interval=<n> or -i <n>
Set minimum packet interval to <n> ms, default=75.
This controls the outgoing bandwidth usage by limiting
the rate at which packets can be sent.  The packet
interval will be no smaller than this number.
The outgoing packets have a total size of 364 bytes
(20 bytes IP hdr + 8 bytes UDP hdr + 336 bytes data)
when the default transform set is used, or 112 bytes
if a custom transform is specified.  Therefore
for default transform set: 50=58240bps, 80=36400bps and
for custom transform: 15=59733bps, 30=35840bps.
.TP
.B --backoff=<b> or -b <b>
Set timeout backoff factor to <b>, default=1.50.
The per-host timeout is multiplied by this factor
after each timeout.  So, if the number of retrys
is 3, the initial per-host timeout is 500ms and the
backoff factor is 1.5, then the first timeout will be
500ms, the second 750ms and the third 1125ms.
.TP
.B --verbose or -v
Display verbose progress messages.
Use more than once for greater effect:
1 - Show when hosts are removed from the list and
when packets with invalid cookies are received;
2 - Show each packet sent and received; and
3 - Display the host and backoff lists before
scanning starts.
.TP
.B --lifetime=<s> or -l <s>
Set IKE lifetime to <s> seconds, default=28800.
RFC 2407 specifies 28800 as the default, but some
implementations may require different values.
If you specify 0, then no lifetime will be specified.
You can use this option more than once in conjunction
with the --trans options to produce multiple transform
payloads with different lifetimes.  Each --trans option
will use the previously specified lifetime value.
.TP
.B --auth=<n> or -m <n>
Set auth. method to <n>, default=1 (pre-shared key).
RFC defined values are 1 to 5.  See RFC 2409 Appendix A.
Checkpoint hybrid mode is 64221.
.TP
.B --version or -V
Display program version and exit.
.TP
.B --vendor=<v> or -e <v>
Set vendor id string to hex value <v>.
You can use this option more than once to send
multiple vendor ID payloads.
.TP
.B --trans=<t> or -a <t>
Use custom transform <t> instead of default set.
<t> is specified as enc[/len],hash,auth,group.
Where enc is the encryption algorithm,
len is the key length for variable length ciphers,
hash is the hash algorithm, and group is the DH Group.
See RFC 2409 Appendix A for details of which values
to use.  For example, --trans=5,2,1,2 specifies
Enc=3DES-CBC, Hash=SHA1, Auth=shared key, DH Group=2
and --trans=7/256,1,1,5 specifies
Enc=AES-256, Hash=MD5, Auth=shared key, DH Group=5.
You can use this option more than once to send
an arbitary number of custom transforms.
.TP
.B --showbackoff[=<n>] or -o[<n>]
Display the backoff fingerprint table.
Display the backoff table to fingerprint the IKE
implementation on the remote hosts.
The optional argument specifies time to wait in seconds
after receiving the last packet, default=60.
If you are using the short form of the option (-o)
then the value must immediately follow the option
letter with no spaces, e.g. -o25 not -o 25.
.TP
.B --fuzz=<n> or -u <n>
Set pattern matching fuzz to <n> ms, default=100.
This sets the maximum acceptable difference between
the observed backoff times and the reference times in
the backoff patterns file.  Larger values allow for
higher variance but also increase the risk of
false positive identifications.
Any per-pattern-entry fuzz specifications in the
patterns file will override the value set here.
.TP
.B --patterns=<f> or -p <f>
Use IKE patterns file <f>,
default=/usr/local/share/ike-scan/ike-backoff-patterns.
This specifies the name of the file containing
IKE backoff patterns.  This file is only used when
--showbackoff is specified.
.TP
.B --aggressive or -A
Use IKE Aggressive Mode (The default is Main Mode)
If you specify --aggressive, then you may also
specify --dhgroup, --id and --idtype.  If you use
custom transforms with aggressive mode with the --trans
option, note that all transforms should have the same
DH Group and this should match the group specified
with --dhgroup or the default if --dhgroup is not used.
.TP
.B --id <id> or -n <id>
Use <id> as the identification value.
This option is only applicable to Aggressive Mode.
<id> should be specified in hex, e.g. --id=deadbeef.
.TP
.B --idtype=n or -y n
Use identification type <n>.  Default 3 (ID_USER_FQDN).
This option is only applicable to Aggressive Mode.
See RFC 2407 4.6.2 for details of Identification types.
.TP
.B --dhgroup=n or -g n
Use Diffie Hellman Group <n>.  Default 2.
This option is only applicable to Aggressive Mode.
