# check-run3 -- Shell script to test ike-scan's lists
#
# Author: Roy Hills
# Date: 13 January 2004
#
# This shell script runs ike-scan with the highest verbose level to display
# the contents of the internal lists: the host list, the backoff list, and
# the vendor id patterns list.  It then checks that all of these lists are
# displayed.
