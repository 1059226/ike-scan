Write body of decode_transforms() function so that we can display details of
the transform picked by the remote IKE implementation rather than just
printing "%d transforms" (where the number is always 1).

Allow specification of GSS identities in the transforms as used by Windows 2000.

Allow display of multiple vendor ID payloads.  Time to re-write the ISAKMP
packet parsing: display_packet() is an absolute mess.

Use "const" for function args that are not modified, and strutures/arrays
that are constant.

Write a user guide.  The README is getting too long now: a seperate document
with proper formatting is required.
