Write body of decode_transforms() function so that we can display details of
the transform picked by the remote IKE implementation rather than just
printing "%d transforms" (where the number is always 1).

Add support for aggressive mode in addition to main mode.  Much of this is
already written in fw1-ike-userguess and just needs to be merged into ike-scan.

Allow specification of GSS identities in the transforms as used by Windows 2000.

Add better comments for functions including details of parameters and return
values.

Reduce the number of global variables in use.  Many of these could be local to
main.  Some functions should take additional parameters rather than using global
vars.

Allow display of multiple vendor ID payloads.  Time to improve the ISAKMP
packet parsing.
