Write a user guide.  The README is getting too long now: a seperate document
with proper formatting is required.  HTML and PDF seem to be the best formats
for this.

Write custom packet creation code.  This would allow an arbitary IKE packet
to be created and sent.  The generation rules would be some sort of
specification file as command-line arguments are not flexible enough for this
task.  Probably parse with yacc/lex to avoid having to write C string handling
and pattern matching.  This would override any command-line options that
define the packet such as --aggressive, --auth, --trans, --dhgroup Etc.

Add option for XML output for easier machine readability.

Decode the currently unhandled ID types: ID_IPV6_ADDR, ID_IPV6_ADDR_SUBNET,
ID_IPV6_ADDR_RANGE, ID_DER_ASN1_DN, and ID_DER_ASN1_GN (never seen these used).

Move the various utility functions in ike-scan.c into utils.c as ike-scan.c
is getting a bit too big.
