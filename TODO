Use "const" for function args that are not modified, and strutures/arrays
that are constant.

Write a user guide.  The README is getting too long now: a seperate document
with proper formatting is required.  HTML and PDF seem to be the best formats
for this.

Review --verbose messages and levels.  There is some inconsistancy with what
is displayed at what level, and with the format of the messages.

The make_trans() function in isakmp.c is getting messy.  Write
make_attribute_b() and make_attribute_v() functions (b=basic, v=variable) to
simplify the attribute creation, and to make it more flexible for future
enhancements.

Write custom packet creation code.  This would allow an arbitary IKE packet
to be created and sent.  The generation rules would be some sort of
specification file as command-line arguments are not flexible enough for this
task.  Probably parse with yacc/lex to avoid having to write C string handling
and pattern matching.  This would override any command-line options that
define the packet such as --aggressive, --auth, --trans, --dhgroup Etc.

Allow output to be in multi-line format for easier human readibility.  Keep
single-line output format for machine readability.

Display details of the returned transform, e.g. Enc=3DES, Hash=SHA1, Auth=PSK,
Group=2.  Need to write transform attribute parseing code for this.

Add option for XML output for easier machine readability.

Add automated tests with "make test" or similar to simplify the basic
functional testing process.
