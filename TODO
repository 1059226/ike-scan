Write body of decode_transforms() function so that we can display details of
the transform picked by the remote IKE implementation rather than just
printing "%d transforms" (where the number is always 1).

Add support for aggressive mode in addition to main mode.  Much of this is
already written in fw1-ike-userguess and just needs to be merged into ike-scan.
