Write body of decode_transforms() function so that we can display details of
the transform picked by the remote IKE implementation rather than just
printing "%d transforms" (where the number is always 1).

Allow specification of GSS identities in the transforms as used by Windows 2000.

Allow display of multiple vendor ID payloads.  Time to improve the ISAKMP
packet parsing.

Use "const" for function args that are not modified, and strutures/arrays
that are constant.
