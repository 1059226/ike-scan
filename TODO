Write body of decode_transforms() function so that we can display details of
the transform picked by the remote IKE implementation rather than just
printing "%d transforms" (where the number is always 1).

Add support for aggressive mode in addition to main mode.  Much of this is
already written in fw1-ike-userguess and just needs to be merged into ike-scan.

Allow specification of GSS identities in the transforms as used by Windows 2000.
This would be a good time to re-write the initial IKE packet generation code,
especially the transforms bit.

Allow specification of multiple vendor ID payloads, e.g. --vendor=dead
--vendor=beef.  It might be easiest to initialise the static parts of the
ike packet _before_ the options parsing and then add the VID payloads as they
are encountered.  Doing this would also allow specification of multiple
custom transforms which could be useful.

Store times in us rather than ms.  This allows better timing because it
avoids the rounding errors that occur with ms timing.  Can either use timevals
or use 64-bit integers for this.
