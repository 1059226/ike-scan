Write body of decode_transforms() function so that we can display details of
the transform picked by the remote IKE implementation rather than just
printing "%d transforms" (where the number is always 1).

Allow the specification of backoff pattern matching fuzz on a per-pattern
or perhaps even a per-backoff basis rather than a single value for all
patterns because some observed patterns have more variation than others.

Add support for aggressive mode in addition to main mode.  Much of this is
already written in fw1-ike-userguess and just needs to be merged into ike-scan.

Port to windows as command line client using Cygwin.
