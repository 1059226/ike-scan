#
# Format:
# Implementation_Name<Tab>Backoff_Pattern
#
# Implementation_Name is a descriptive name for the IKE implementation
# (and version if applicable).  Backoff_Pattern is the observed IKE
# retransmission backoff pattern for this implementation.
#
# The backoff pattern is specified as a comma-seperated list of backoffs
# in seconds.  The first number is always zero and represents the first
# packet received.  For example, "0, 2, 2, 2" means that a total of four
# packets are sent with a delay of two seconds between each one.
#
# Lines beginning with '#' and blank lines are ignored.
