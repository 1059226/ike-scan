# backoff-patterns -- Backoff patterns file for ike-scan
#
# Author: Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>
#
# Format:
# Implementation_Name<Tab>Backoff_Pattern
#
# Implementation_Name is a descriptive name for the IKE implementation
# (and version if applicable).  Backoff_Pattern is the observed IKE
# retransmission backoff pattern for this implementation.
#
# The backoff pattern is specified as a comma-seperated list of backoffs
# in seconds.  The first number is always zero and represents the first
# packet received.  For example, "0, 2, 2, 2" means that a total of four
# packets are sent with a delay of two seconds between each one.
#
# The numbers in the backoff pattern can be decimal numbers e.g. 1.5 for
# one and a half seconds.  ike-scan uses strtod(3) to convert the ascii
# representation to a floating point number which is then converted into a
# timeval struct.
#
# Lines beginning with '#' and blank lines are ignored.
#
# The input format is quite strict.  In particular, the separator between
# the implementation name and the backoff pattern must be a single TAB and
# not a space, multiple tabs or spaces, or a mixture of tabs and spaces.
#
# If you have problems adding entries, run ike-scan as:
# ike-scan -v -v -v -o <any-target>
# To dump the backoff pattern table.
#
# You are encouraged to send comments, improvements or suggestions to
# me at ike-scan@nta-monitor.com.
# In particular, I would like you to submit any new patterns that you
# discover.  See:
# http://www.nta-monitor.com/ike-scan/submit.htm
# For details of how to submit new backoff patterns.
