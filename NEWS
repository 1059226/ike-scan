This file gives a brief overview of the major changes between each ike-scan
release.  For more details please read the ChangeLog file.

ike-scan v1.6:

* ike-scan will now display multiple Vendor ID payloads if the server sends
  more than one.  Previously, it would only display the first Vendor ID and
  ignore the others.

* Added support for ISAKMP lifetime size transform attribute with the
  --lifesize (-z) option.  Default is 0 which means don't include the
  lifetime size attribute.

ike-scan v1.5.1:

* Fixed a bug which could cause a negative value to be passed to select()
  when collecting backoff fingerprints.  This would result in select()
  returning EINVAL.

ike-scan v1.5:

* Aggressive mode is now supported.  The --aggressive (-A) option specifies
  aggressive mode.

* The --trans option can be specified multiple times to generate an arbitary
  number of custom transforms in the ISAKMP SA Proposal.

* The --vendor option can be specified multiple times to generate an arbitary
  number of Vendor ID payloads.

* UDP engine improvements: Dynamically adjust select() timeout, removing the
  need for a --selectwait argument; keep track of cumulative timing error, and
  use this to adjust the timing to compensate; calculate timings in
  microseconds rather than milliseconds to improve accuracy; and some minor
  tuning.

ike-scan v1.4:

* Two additions to permit Vendor ID fingerprinting.
  1. Allow the specification of an arbitary Vendor ID payload using the
     --vendor option.
  2. Display any Vendor ID payload returned by the target host.

ike-scan v1.3:	(Unofficial release)

* Added support for per-pattern-entry fuzz values in the backoff patterns
  file which allows more complex backoff patterns to be matched.
* Added new backoff patterns for "watchguard-soho" and "sonicwall-pro".

ike-scan v1.2:

* Fixed format string vulnerability in syslog() call.
* ike-scan now builds and runs on HP Tru64 Unix.

ike-scan v1.1:

* Added new backoff patterns for Cisco Concentrator and isakmpd.
* ike-scan now builds and runs on Windows/Cygwin, old libc5 Linux systems, and
  Solaris 2.8 / SPARC.
* Windows command-line binary released.

ike-scan v1.0: (Initial release)

* Compiles and runs on Debian Linux 2.2 "potato" and 3.0 "woody", FreeBSD 4.3,
  and OpenBSD 3.1.
