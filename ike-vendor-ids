# ike-vendor-ids -- File containing known Vendor IDs for ike-scan
#
# Author: Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>
#
# Format:
# Implementation_Name<Tab>Vendor_ID_Pattern
#
# The Vendor_ID_Pattern should be specified as a basic regular expression
# that will match the hex value of the Vendor ID.  The Posix regular
# expression routines "regcomp" and "regexec" are used to compile and
# match the petterns.
#
# The hex value of the Vendor ID can only contain the characters [0-9a-f].
# The regular expression match is case insensitive, so you can use either
# upper or lower case letters [A-F] in the pattern.
#
# The pattern is not anchored by default.  If you want to match from the
# beginning of the vendor ID hex value (which is often the case), you
# should start your pattern with "^".  If you don't want to allow any
# extra trailing data, you should end the pattern with "$".
#
# Each entry must be on one line.
#
# Lines beginning with '#' and blank lines are ignored.
#
# You are encouraged to send comments, improvements or suggestions to
# me at ike-scan@nta-monitor.com.
