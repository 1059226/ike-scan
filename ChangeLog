2003-07-10 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* ike-backoff-patterns: Added new patterns "watchguard-soho" and
	  "sonicwall-pro".  These both use the new "/" notation to represent
	  per-entry fuzz values.
	* ike-scan.c: Add fact that per-pattern fuzz entries override the
	  values specified with --fuzz to the help output.

2003-07-10 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* ike-scan.c: Added check_struct_sizes() to check the size of the
	  ISAKMP structure sizes.
	* ike-scan.h: Added definition of check_struct_sizes().

2003-07-04 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* ike-scan.c: Added support for per-pattern-entry fuzz specification
	  in the patterns file.
	* ike-scan.h: New structure to support per-pattern-entry fuzz.

2003-06-27 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* ike-scan.c: Improved backoff pattern display in dump_backoff().
	  Use integer arithmetic in add_pattern() to avoid rounding errors.
	* ike-scan.h: Remove math.h include.  Not needed now that we use
	  integer aritmetic in add_pattern().
	* configure.ac: Removed check for maths library.  Not needed now that
	  we use integer aritmetic in add_pattern().

2003-06-17 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* ike-scan.1: Created man page ike-scan.1.  This is required by some
	  Linux distributions e.g. Debian.
	* Makefile.am: Added support for new man page.
	* NEWS: Added info for v1.0, v1.1 and v1.2.
	* Makefile.am: Changed location of "ike-backoff-patterns" from
	  $datadir to $pkgdatadir.

	* Released version v1.2.  Tarball size 108137 bytes, Zip size 620292.

2003-06-11 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* ike-backoff-patterns: Minor comment changes.

2003-05-10 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac: Added package name and version to AC_INIT.

	* ike-scan.c: Use PACKAGE_STRING and PACKAGE_BUGREPORT symbols rather
	  than hard-coded strings.

2003-05-09 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac, acinclude.m4: Wrote macro AC_NTA_NET_SIZE_T to
	  determine the best type to use for the 3rd argument to accept().
	  This is normally socklen_t, but is sometimes int or size_t.
	  This change allows the program to compile on HP Tru64 Unix.

2003-05-08 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac: Renamed configure.in to configure.ac to comply with
	  new autoconf naming scheme and ran autoupdate to update from
	  autoconf 2.13 to 2.53.  No C code changes.

2003-02-21 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* error.c: Changed "syslog(level, buf)" to "syslog(level, "%s", buf)"
	  to fix syslog format string vulnerability.

2003-02-18 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Released version v1.1.  Tarball size 91606 bytes, Zip size 578034.
	  tarball md5sum: b87fe14043c43c2897cf309c364574b7
	  zip md5sum: 59db0f1f170aaf50dfb2c05f4f950d00
	* Corrected typo in README-WIN32: know -> known.

2003-02-03 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Makefile.am: Changed DATADIR to IKEDATADIR.
	* ike-scan.h: Include <windows.h> if compiling under Cygwin.
	* ike-scan.c: Use ike-scan.exe dir as default patterns file dir
	  if compiling under Cygwin.
	* ike-scan now compiles under Cygwin and can be used as a Windows EXE
	  if CYGWIN1.DLL is present.

2003-01-30 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Minor changes to --help output to make use of <> brackets
	  consistent.

2003-01-29 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* ike-scan.c: Added output of "Ending:" line showing number of hosts
	  scanned and number of responders after scan completes.
	* ike-scan.c: Only show backoff table if there is at least one
	  handshake responder.
	* ike-scan.c: Don't bother waiting for extra packets after all host
	  entries have been removed if there are no handshake responders.
	* ike-scan.c: Show that notify message 9101 is Firewall-1 4.x or NG
	  in output message.
	* ike-scan.c: Cast value from htonl to uint32_t when used in printf
	  statement to avoid warnings on those platforms which define htonl
	  as returning unsigned long (like FreeBSD).
	* ike-backoff-patterns: Added OpenBSD-isakmpd, discovered by Thomas
	  Walpuski.

2003-01-27 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Fixed possible buffer overflow in code which joined argv elements
	  into a fixed-length string which is then written to syslog.
	* Removed RSA 1991 MD5 implementation and replaced with
	  L. Peter Deutsch's MD5 implementation dated 2002.

2003-01-25 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Moved all #includes to ike-scan.h.
	* ike-scan.c, ike-scan.h: Changed host_entry element "n" from int to
	  unsigned.
	* ike-scan.c: Changed printf format for unsigned from %d to %u.
	* ike-scan.c: Added exchange type (Main Mode or Aggressive Mode) to
	  "handshake returned" message.
	* ike-scan.h: Make all #includes conditional based on configure findings
	* configure.in: Check for uint_8, uint_16 and u_int32 types using
	  custom macro AC_NTA_CHECK_TYPE (defined in acinclude.m4).  If the
	  types are not defined, then #define them to values that will work on
	  most systems.
	* ike-scan now builds and runs on two new platforms:
	  - Debian Linux 1.3.1 (old libc5 based Linux system with 2.0 kernel)
	  - Cygwin on Windows NT Workstation (only under the cygwin
	    environment; this doesn't produce a standalone windows exe).

2003-01-23 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* ike-backoff-patterns: Changed Cisco Concentrator entry to 0,8,8,8

2003-01-20 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Released initial version v1.0. Tarball size 86434 bytes,
	  md5sum: 7299777c7d67d1cea82d9594867b4806
